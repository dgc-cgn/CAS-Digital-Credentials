## Overview of this Repository

This repository contains industry and government expert contributions in support of the developments of standards-based conformity assessment schemes for digital credentials, digital trust services and digital wallets.

## Strategic Context

This content and supporting tools are intended to contribute to the establishment of digital trust, enablement of national and international interoperability, and the mitigation of related risks.

This repository and associated deliverables are intended to support strategic outcomes of:

* Fostering standardization for the future of the digital credential ecosystem
* Establish a baseline of trust for products, processes and services.
* Enable interoperabilty across jurisdictions and economic sectors
* Mitigate risks of vendor lock-in, ecosystem fragmentation and platform capture

This repository is intended to provide the context of a prototype conformity assessment scheme for which the technical specification may be applied.

## Immediate Objectives

* To develop a publicly available Github repository, consisting of conformity assessment scheme elements that can be used to define conformity assessment criteria to support conformity assessment programs.
* Content is developed on a continuous basis by contributing technical experts. Draft publications will be made available on a periodic basis for peer review and publication.

## Work Completed to Date

The expert drafting team has defining the **objects of conformity** for inclusion in a technical specification. 

The [Final Version of TS-115](https://dgc-cgn.org/standards/find-a-standard/standards-in-digital-credentials/digital-credentials/) has now been published
